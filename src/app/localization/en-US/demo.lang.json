Localization (l10n), is the process of adapting applications and text to enable their usability in a particular cultural or linguistic market. For application developers, internationalizing an application means abstracting all of the strings and other locale-specific bits (such as date or currency formats) out of the application. Localizing an application means providing translations and localized formats for the abstracted bits.",
